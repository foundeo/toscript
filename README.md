# toScript()

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/foundeo/toscript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/foundeo/toscript)

Converts tag based CFML code into CFML Script.

## Usage

Invoke the `toScript(filePath="", options={}, fileContent="")` function. 

### Options

The `options` struct currently only supports one option `indentChars` which defaults to a tab character. You could pass `{indentChars="    "}` if you wanted to indent with 4 spaces instead of a tabs.

To see an example of how it works look at the unit tests. It converts a Tag Based CFC Test Suite [TagTemplate.cfc](https://github.com/foundeo/toscript/blob/master/tests/tests/TagTemplate.cfc) into a Script CFC test suite [GeneratedScriptCode.cfc](https://github.com/foundeo/toscript/blob/master/tests/tests/GeneratedScriptCode.cfc)	


### Example

	converter = new ToScript();
	result = converter.toScript(filePath="someFile.cfc");
	fileWrite("result.cfc", result.code);

## Generated CFML Script

All of the generated script should run on ColdFusion 11+ or Lucee 4.5+ 

Much of it will also run on older versions of CFML, but it depends on which tags you use.
